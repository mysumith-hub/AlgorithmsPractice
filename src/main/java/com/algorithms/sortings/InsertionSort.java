/**
 * 
 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm, it builds the final sorted
 * array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than other
 * sort algorithms.
 * 
 * Advantages of Insertion Sort:
 * 
 * 1) It is very simple. 2) It is very efficient for small data sets. 3) It is
 * stable; i.e., it does not change the relative order of elements with equal
 * keys. 4) In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional
 * memory space.
 * 
 * Insertion sort iterates through the list by consuming one input element at
 * each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. On a repetition, insertion
 * sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs
 * within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input
 * elements remain.
 * 
 * 
 * The best case input is an array that is already sorted. In this case
 * insertion sort has a linear running time (i.e., Î˜(n)). During each iteration,
 * the first remaining element of the input is only compared with the right-most
 * element of the sorted subsection of the array. The simplest worst case input
 * is an array sorted in reverse order. The set of all worst case inputs
 * consists of all arrays where each element is the smallest or second-smallest
 * of the elements before it. In these cases every iteration of the inner loop
 * will scan and shift the entire sorted subsection of the array before
 * inserting the next element. This gives insertion sort a quadratic running
 * time (i.e., O(n2)). The average case is also quadratic, which makes insertion
 * sort impractical for sorting large arrays. However, insertion sort is one of
 * the fastest algorithms for sorting very small arrays, even faster than
 * quicksort; indeed, good quicksort implementations use insertion sort for
 * arrays smaller than a certain threshold, also when arising as subproblems;
 * the exact threshold must be determined experimentally and depends on the
 * machine, but is commonly around ten.
