/**
 * 
Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm.

Steps to implement Merge Sort:

1) Divide the unsorted array into n partitions, each partition contains 1 element. Here the one element is considered as sorted.
2) Repeatedly merge partitioned units to produce new sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. 
This will be the sorted list at the end.
